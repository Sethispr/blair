We provide the bot completely free for you and everyone to enjoy. We do our very best to keep it online and running smoothly but sometimes updates or unexpected issues happen. You can always check the current status in the status channel on our official support server. There is no uptime guarantee but we will always try to fix problems as fast as possible. Please do remember that there is only 1 developer for this bot so bug fixes, new features, card releases, etc may take days or weeks.
